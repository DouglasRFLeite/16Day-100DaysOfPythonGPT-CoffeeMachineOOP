# 16Day-100DaysOfPythonGPT-CoffeeMachineOOP
Day 16 of the [100 Days of Code with Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) from Udemy.

## What is 100DaysOfPythonGPT?

100 Days of Python is a Python Bootcamp from Udemy that provides 100 days of Python pratical content with lessons and projects. The GPT part is something I'm adding to the course and infers that I shall use ChatGPT's engine and/or API in some way on each and every one of those 100 projects. Furthermore, I shall also practice using PyTest to test these projects and applications at least in some level.

## CoffeeMachineOOP

Coffee Machine OOP is the sixteenth project of the sixteenth Day of the bootcamp. Its supposed to be an introduction to OOP recreating the coffe machine with OOP, but only using OOP, without creating it, that means the course provided the classes already defined and the purpose is to call the methods to work like the coffee machine.

I have not used GPT nor Test for this because my old Coffee Machine is already using OOP.
